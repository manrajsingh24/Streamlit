It is understandable that new programs have longer quote lead times, but Aptiv is far slower than all other suppliers. Even revisions requested by Aptiv can take 1-2 months to quote.

Aptiv should also do a better job of presenting one global face to the customer. Delivery and quality performance for Aptiv Mexico is worse than Brazil and Portugal. Additionally, the global engineering, program management, and account management teams are not well aligned for global programs. 

We would like Aptiv to offer tooling with quality levels that align to customer needs. We have some programs that require top tier quality versus other programs that need less expensive tooling.

They do not see APTIV interested to grow business based on Engineering Value and quality, but just on collecting DCR and money but not respecting the commitment afterwards. Overall there were also some questions about what happen in TCK and the newpaper articles on how we treated our employees, they were very surpirsed as APTIV was known to be a reliable and good supplier and this made them wondering about APTIV overall strategy.

5/29/2024 16:35,Riccardo L'Innocente,Engineering,Paolo Scoccia,5,"The feedback is the result of internal review with several STLA team members in daily contact with APTIV. They all strongly complained about the reduction of quality and service that APTIV is offering them compared to few years before. We have been compared to be the worst of the electronic supplier in terms of support and service unfortunately. What for example ahs been reported as big complain is how we poorly managed the still present issue about battery discharge on keyfob for Dodge Hornet and Alfa Tonale. They consider the attitude of how APTIV managed this case as very upsetting showing either poor knowhow within the Engineering and Project Team assigned to the issue and also the lack of reactivity and ""care"" of field issues. I personally got the impression that they perceived APTIV not playing fairly and not providing credibility. Second point is how APTIV managed the closure of OSB plant moving production without caring about STLA requirements and rules. APTIV has simply demonstrated a very bad attitude, without caring of clear written rules and without being able to explain why. APTIV has been perceived quite arrogant. Last remark: continuous change of team and interfaces: we lost knowhow and customer is extremely upset. APTIV became extremely expensive and had the bad attitude to just delay offers and not having the resources skills committed for awarded or agreed business.",RObust customer team and customer centric organiation are key to secure current and future business. we won't get anymore support from STLA engineering if we don't show that APTIV offers additional value and able to care of the customer.,see above - we must follow up on Keyfob low battery issue,no,we need to provide a better image of APTIV offering the level of support they were used to get in the past assigning resources with the adequate level of seniority and knowhow.

I showed sympathy and listened to his logic as to why he graded Aptiv with a 2 rating. The customer was very dissatisfied with the time it takes for issue turnaround and data driven responses from Aptiv.  In addition, the customer seems to think we lack a sense of urgency with pilot plant quality issues and information needed from the APAC Aptiv team to resolve validation issues.  The customer likes Aptiv as a supplier, but our actions are driving them toward Tyco.","I learned that showing empathy to the customers concerns, listening to the voice of the customer, and making the follow-up personal mends the relationship.

We are documenting all issues in weekly OPL meetings with Stellantis and prioritizing tasks that need completion. In addition, we are engaging our Aptiv teams in EMEA and APAC region for support.","As the customer stated our efforts will speak louder than words, so we have to show the ease of doing business with Aptiv and deliver on our promised commitments.  The customer was intrigued by the follow-up meeting and commented that Stellantis wants Aptiv as a business partner moving forward.","I am creating a gap-closure plan on addressing the customers stated concerns.  I expect to see progress in each area.  In addition, I have suggested a bi-monthly follow-up meeting with the customer to show the areas of improvement, driven results, and team collaboration.",Issue(s) identified and unresolved – further action required,,CS,,,frank.kolcaj@stellantis.com,Stellantis,Engineering Manager - PDC,"Since approximately mid-last year, we have observed a decline in the level of support and feedback provided by Aptiv. Notably, there has been a discernible lag in response times, particularly concerning matters of engineering and quality. An illustrative instance of this challenge is an ongoing issue spanning several months, where collaboration with the Aptiv China Team has been less than optimal. Instead of presenting a cohesive front, the Aptiv NA team has recommended that Stellantis engineers start escalating the matter within Aptiv NA management to elicit more robust feedback from their counterparts in China. This fragmented approach, characterized by multiple points of contact within Aptiv, has introduced complexity into our communication channels and hindered timely issue resolution.
Furthermore, there have been notable instances where progress on critical projects has been impeded, exemplified by Aptiv's reluctance to proceed with issuing Change Notices (CNs) for essential subcomponents that are PIA to an end item they own such as pin protection cover or dress covers. Rather, they have directed us to engage directly with tier 2 suppliers, even though we work directly with the teir 1s on other programs.  In addition, they at times hold engineering changes hostage on a program pending resolution of a commercial or other issues they have had with completely different teams and programs.  Essentially making an engineering team suffer to solve another issue that no one has anything to do with.
In summary, our team perceives a prevailing sentiment that Stellantis is not viewed as a valued customer or partner by Aptiv over the past year. We assert that there exists an opportunity for enhancement in communication protocols, responsiveness, and collaborative efforts to ensure streamlined operations and foster a more mutually beneficial partnership in the future.","Need ownership over projects and issues.  One project lead on a given connector system from Aptiv that can work internally with Aptiv members to develop and track a plan to completion.  Including timing, open issues lists, next steps, one pager, ect.. 

Need faster turnaround when there is a build issue or quality/performance issue.  It takes weeks just to get a response to a request in some cases, build issues need support within the next day, and plans put together ASAP.

Work better with our other suppliers when Aptiv is a teir 1, we get feedback from other connector/component suppliers that they are difficult to work with, do not order parts on time, or constantly have to pull in Stellantis for teir 2 discussions instead of leading."

My rating of 8 out of 10 is in the sense that generally the work is in reactive way, that is, once a critical situation happens, then you look for how to move, do things, etc. I think there is still a lack of preventive work, in the day-to-day on how to prevent, avoid certain critical situations, that once they happen, even if there is enormous availability to correct it, at the end of the day the impact has already happened, and that excellent work can be overshadowed a bit given the crisis in a certain situation. Examples: Stop Shipments, FSA, QRs responses with customer.

 I would like also to say as your Site STA who directly sees the work you do every day, I recognize an improvement, there has been a before and after in the client-supplier relationship in favor of continuous improvement and that is appreciated.

You just have to keep working and pushing to work more on the preventive, ensuring you follow your own standards, processes, quality controls and sub-tier management.

Some good: •	Ease of doing business 9 - Aptiv is flexible at implementing some changes and resolving issues. Trevor complimented Aptiv on being available to discuss issues and meeting on short notice to discuss solutions. (Applies to Application Engineer, Sales Manager, Program Manager, Product Engineer). Aptiv compares favorably to other suppliers on availability.
•	Issue resolution 9 - Trevor complimented Aptiv for being able to implement the change to add tailgate latch content at the last minute for SOP. Aptiv and STLA worked outside the normal CN process to make it happen.
Some issues where Aptiv needs improvement: Delivery reliability 5 - Issue: during PV testing issues were found with the buss bars breaking. Trevor believes this issue should have been virtually validated prior to having physical parts available. He said 5 may be too low. Aptiv Product Engineering has reviewed this item and causes and has added a buss bar review to their process for future PDC development. It is difficult to simulate via computer analysis.
Trevor commented that Aptiv management held up some CN processing to wait for resolution on previous CN and PO issues. CN 30309-T01 was an internal STLA CN that needed to be spun at $0 to make math and other minor changes. This held up subsequent CNs as well.",,The customer feels that it takes Aptiv too long to quote changes and update prints.,There should be a mechanism to quote normal engineering changes as a delta without waiting for multiple estimates.

Andrea noted that Ford is moving very fast and she appreciates the timely response to texts, calls and emails. When Ford is running fast the sales team is definitely running with them and there are not issues in that regard.
Andrea has an overall concern with how Aptiv as a whole does business with Ford. Andrea noted that she has brought this up with senior leadership at Aptiv and she is not sure if it is intentional or if Aptiv doesn't get it. She noted that when Ford sources business they expect every supplier to look into their crystal ball and to ask all their experts (IHS, market analyst, etc.) and put their best estimate into their quote. Following the program award we should only be talking about manufacturing efficiencies and engineering changes. If another buyer comes to Andrea, right now she doesn't feel that she can recommend Aptiv. She noted that Ford can't afford to do business with Aptiv. Andrea noted that Ford thought the give back at the end of the year would improve the relationship but it has only gotten worse. She noted that the current approach is not fair to other supplier who who may have bid the business fairly. The feeling at Ford is that when Aptiv runs into a cost issue, they do not look at offsets. Andrea noted that the semiconductor market is softening along with energy. She would like to know where Ford's other savings are. She also noted that Ford feels that they funded most of the broker buys. Andrea noted that Aptiv needs to understand that when they are awarded business, the only prices changes should be related to engineering changes. She noted that she had nothing negative to say about the transactional side of the business but the cost side is not working. She is very frustrated that Aptiv is asking for an increase on cameras. Why didn't Aptiv ask for this when they quoted it? She noted that in summary this is the biggest issue that is holding Aptiv back at Ford.",Andrea is pleased with support from the account and the transactional side of the business but she if very frustrated with cost related issues.,Need to resolve cost related piece of the relationship and improve on quote timing.,Quote turn around time continues to be an issue.

As a buyer, this is extremely valuble to me.  Aptiv's largest hurtle is their inability to manage their cost challenges.  At start of a new progam, a supplier is to quote their best cost as Job #1.  This includes their projection of future life of program costs into their quote.  In theory, once sourced, the only costs that should be discussed are TVM cost saves from plant floor efficiency.  Aptiv brings all their cost challenges to Ford to fund, and this is not in the spirit of how Best Cost at Job #1 is to work.

4/3/2024 9:52,Waseem Khan,Purchasing,Oliver Little,5,"Last Wednesday I went through the NPS scorecard feedback with Waseem in Gaydon. Below is a summary of notes taken in the room. 
2 consistent themes which influence most of the points:

1.	Lack of trust in Aptiv within JLR purchasing seniors due to 2020 re-price and 2023 D8 settlement claims. Aptiv do not have a long term partnership mentality, happy to use non-renew threat. Other EDS suppliers approached JLR for similar discussions in a more constructive manner.
2.	Aptiv are less visible than competitors who (with benefit of current business) promote activities such as future factory, sustainability. These topics have visibility and focus at multiple levels within JLR and are recognized as partnership behaviors. 


Outside of this there was no evidence of negatives for quality, program execution, reliability or day to day working relationship. These were all just considered BAU given no real issues. 

Focus, from Waseem’s perspective, is for JLR to understand what Aptiv’s vision is for future relationship. Importance of upcoming QBR in this process with senior teams.","Major issues cited are not a surprise. Frustration from JLR that Aptiv have made multiple standalone claims throughout 2023 from EDS, CS and ASUX, and perception is that Aptiv are not focused on a future relationship with JLR.",,Quarterly business review set for 2024 Q2.

4/2/2024 20:50,Parul Arya,Purchasing,Mark Intihar,8,"Overall, biggest issue is lack of ""OneAptiv"" approach when dealing with different manufacturing plants/regions.  This is consistent with feedback to leadership teams.

Regarding quality: most other suppliers haven't had issues once products are in production compared to Aptiv

Regarding Innovation: We don't see the automation in Mexico and EU that we are seeing in China and the industry needs to move in that direction.  Other suppliers are actively pursuing Mexico automation, haven't heard a lot from Aptiv other than initial H422.

Regarding speed: Aptiv is awesome when launching a new project; once programs get to production, things tend to slow down (i.e. engineering changes)

Regarding Delivery Reliability: past inventory situations are still lingering in mind, but nothing current comes to mind","When asked about number rankings ""7s should have been 8s, 8s should have been 9s""

Things are very good with sales and PM with current leadership.  Would like to see a little bit more empowerment at lower levels commercially.","Proliferation of automation from China to other regions - need to stay ahead of competition on this

Quality issues once in production seem to occur at much higher rates than other suppliers.  Chargebacks received show evidence of this.","Parul intends to be a promoter of Aptiv and is trying to give pointed feedback to get us to the next level.  I think focusing on automation is going to be key to continue our success with the customer long term.  

Parul also offered up that we should really look at optimizing our logistics as a sustainability initiative, sees this as a way for Aptiv to improve speed as well as reduce footprint.","Book travel to China for global sales review; focus on automation discussions.

Another thing that I'd like to point out is that Aptiv needs to change the way they request something from Ford, almost 100% of their requests they didn't provide enough information to us, and once they do, they didn't give us enough time to review them to verify if it's ""ok"" or if more information is needed, wanting us to give them a response as soon as possible (less than a week) and if not, they used to threaten us.

generally good working with Aptiv.

Communication within Aptiv seems to be bad. Aptiv CN sometimes agrees to changes that other regions aren't okay with.

Answers are not quick due to global discussion. Should only take 2-3, especially for simple answers.

A lot of struggle dealing with quality issues. A lot of fighting to deal with suspect or actual quality issues. Aptiv is standoff-ish and trying to not be involved unless there is solid proof that it's an Aptiv quality issue.

That is also true for any issues surrounding engineering.

However, to be honest, I think there needs to be a separate team created to resolve the issues that affect customer relations (in this case, the bad internal communication and discussion about quality of product). The similarity in those two is COMMUNICATION. Though I understand the importance of these discussions and resolving them, I don't think anyone in my team has the bandwidth to solely create a plan for these issues, kick them off, and follow up. Our expertise and focus is in ENGINEERING. I can initiate these discussions with the customer, but to correct any issues and follow up with them should be the responsibility of a team TRAINED for customer-relations and team management.

1. Aptiv's threatening behavior
2. Disconnects between departments in Aptiv, giving slow response times
3. Lack of proactive management of supply issues

For point 1 he mentioned that Aptiv ASUX has been improving but JLR often discuss cross commodity and it heavily influences their decisions. He recommended that we work more closely as One Aptiv and have a uniformed approach. As one commodity can easily spoil the relationship of others.

Point 2 and 3 are largely related to performance of the plant in Macedonia around the supply issues. Historically we were supporting them well but in recent times he feels there is a ""stand off"" behavior and almost an expectation that JLR manage the situation for us. JLR are frustrated at having to coach the plant. They want more communication and less ""blaming or throwing over responsibility"".

He commented that the plant moves and warehouse closures have been a mess. With rushed timelines and even after completion, the new routes not being used.

There is a largely differing opinion of working with the ASUX commercial team, but he is fully satisfied with the working relationship he has (mentioning myself and James Allsopp as the key contacts).

He particularly mentioned the support on semi-con shortages, Secure23, Secure24 and Secure25 is / was perfect and he would score it 10/10. He spoke to Carlos (Secure team lead) who echoed the opinion that the Aptiv commercial team is easy to work with and reply back with information in a timely manner.

He mentioned that the rest of the purchasing team (Dan McCarthy + Dean Beard) have been complaining internally about the relationship and there has been shock about the relationship he has with Aptiv (that it is positive).

The negative complaints he has heard internally revolve around the threatening nature of Aptiv's commercial discussions. He mentioned also that Aptiv typically works to a very fast timeline, which JLR can't keep up with. He mentioned the move from Singapore to Hungary for the Radar business, suggesting that we could engage earlier with JLR so there is more time to prepare. He didn't appreciate the threats that there will be no parts if they don't keep up with our timelines.

He specifically mentioned that the ease of business is down to the direct relationship he has with me, knowing there is a mutual respect, even taking Aptiv's sides in some discussions.","The same echoes are here about aggressive commercial behaviour, and that reputation is spilling over into areas that have a good relationship with us.

The customer's experience shows that on average warranty returns from other suppliers are rare, maybe 2 per month, in the case of Aptive it is about 2 per week.

The main problem is the zFAS project - MTF problems, lack of compliance with Formel Q requirements.

The warranty process itself is fine. There are also no objections to the people responsible for warranty returns, they know how to set work priorities well. However, the number of warranty returns is too high.

Therefore, a rating of 7 for the quality of the products is fair at this moment. However, the customer stated that if the number of complaints does not decrease, the rating will not be so high next year.",It is important to ensure that the problems currently present in the zFAS project are not repeated in GSR2 project which is currently in development phase.,,Issue(s) identified and unresolved – no further action,,ASUX,,,thomas2.winkler@audi.de,Volkswagen,Supplier Quality Fahrwerk Ingolstadt,N/A,N/A

Innovative products - fuseboxes as today is not a rocket science and the playing field is fairly leveled. Its hard to compete on standard technology with fuses manufacturers, JLR doesn't see anything outstanding in traditional Aptiv fuseboxes comparing to other suppliers. JLR noticed linkedin campaign from Aptiv, and it was well received. 

Ease of doing business	- red cross label, long time for change introduction due to admin work of PO creation. poor response from plant side in terms of supporting vendor master data correction. many meeting dates changes , poor support of the meeting and no real will to close the topic in shortest time. 
regarding water ingress to EJB - case where JLR had to escalate to get feedback from testing results / simulation results. 

Understanding needs - Aptiv understand needs very well, however for some reason doesn't put enough resources to support customer needs. 

Program execution - above average, rather swift responses. Appraisal based on CR execution not on product development. 

Issue resolution - based on time of CRs for red cross label / water ingress - must be improved immediately.

No real innovation in currently offered products. we are competing with new starters which are offering more appealing products than we do. 

Ease of making business / issue resolution - few rounds which are not brining expected results. Customer feels, Aptiv wants to persuade own way of making business, where JLR have to follow internal processes. That causes tensions and feeling that Aptiv doesn't understand making business with JLR.
